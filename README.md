hangman_2
=========

A simple hangman game written in Ruby where the user has eight chances to guess the word.

hangmanKQ.rb was the first iteration of the game and used many instance variables.
This resulted in more consise code but is not ideal, and risky, use of instance variables.

hangman_refactored.rb is the updated version that minimizes instance variable use by
making greater use of local variable passing.
